package main

/*
Put a breakpoint at 'println("ok")' and debug the 'main' function. Once breakpoint is reached, check out a list of goroutines
in the debugger. Goroutine names include the following information: /api/profile, userId: <some number>. You can use this
information to find a particular goroutine during debugging and core dump analysis.

To learn more about pprof labels, see https://rakyll.org/profiler-labels/.
